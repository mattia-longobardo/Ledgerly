# API changelog

Changes to `/api/v1` and to the MCP tools (`/api/mcp`). Every change below is additive: a client
written before it keeps working.

## 2026-10-28 · display currency (PERS-82)

Each account keeps its own currency; totals across accounts are converted to the user's display
currency (Settings › Profile, default `EUR`) at the ECB rate of their day
(`docs/design/investments.md` §1.8).

- `GET /api/v1/summary` and the MCP tool `get_summary`: new field `currency`, the display currency
  of `netWorth`, `previousNetWorth` and `cash`. `netWorthPartial` and `cashPartial` are now also
  `true` when an account counted has no exchange rate to that currency (it is left out, never
  counted 1:1). `income`, `expense` and `net` are unchanged: sums of the month's transactions,
  not converted.
- `GET /api/v1/accounts`, `GET /api/v1/accounts/{id}/balances` and the MCP tools `list_accounts`,
  `get_account_balances`: unchanged. `balance` is the account's own value in its `currency`.
- The MCP server's instructions now say which currency each amount is in.

With every account in EUR and the display currency EUR, every value is the same as before.
